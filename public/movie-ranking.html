<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO BREEZER</h1>

<H2>My top three movies of all time:</H2>

<hr />

<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>

<p>This is such a wholesome movie that provides laughs for the whole family</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>Such an incredible story of a man who is wrongly accused and fights the system</p>

<h3>Anne Of Green Gables</h3>

<p>A classic film of an orphan girl with red hair</p>
